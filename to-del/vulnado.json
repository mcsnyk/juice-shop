Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor occurs when any party who does not require this information for business purposes can remove this information from the secure network.\nConsequences of exposure can include holding it for ransom payment, identity theft, or access to other internal network resources-along with financial loss due to regulatory fines, court settlements, or cost to restore compromised systems. As most attackers aim to extract sensitive information, this CWE only describes exploits that take advantage of vulnerabilities related to how data is handled: the management, storage, transfer, or removal of sensitive information.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n- Encrypt data at all times, whether in transit or at rest.\n- When transporting data, always use a secure protocol such as TLS.\n- Before collecting PII or financial information, consider whether there is a true business need for this information; similarly, before storing the data, ensure that there is an ongoing business need.\n- Classify all incoming data according to privacy and security guidelines to improve awareness of sensitive data.\n- Ensure that caching is disabled for all transactions involving sensitive information.\n- Store passwords with secure, salted hashing functions.\n- Apply a network-wide least-privilege policy so sensitive data is provided only to users with business need to know.",

Therefore, it is important for developers to design software that considers these real-world physical (or virtual) limitations and limits user sessions accordingly, both in terms of the number of user sessions and in the quantity of resources each user may demand. Software with this weakness does not include such limitations and as a result, individual user sessions may consume too many resources, leading to unintended software behavior including, potentially, denial of service. This can be compared to a single restaurant customer emptying out the entire buffet, leaving no food for other customers--or an entire busload mobbing the buffet all at once, with a similar effect. This may happen inadvertently or as a result of an attack by a malicious user.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Test extensively to obtain baseline values indicating how the software performs in the real world under various conditions (normal and peak); use these values to determine reasonable software limits.\n* Set clear limits for all flexible parameters such as maximum allocable memory, number of processes within a given timeframe, file descriptors, requests per client, number of records per request, etc. This is particularly true for any parameters within user control.\n* Release all resources when no longer in use, including incorporating timeouts for inactive users, processes, and resources.\n* Familiarize Dev, Ops, and IT teams with best practices for recognizing and preventing DoS attacks and out-of-control resource allocation to prevent catastrophic failures.",

For example, if a breached authentication token is hardcoded in multiple places in the application, it may lead to components of the application remaining vulnerable if not all instances are changed.\nAnother negative effect of hard-coding constants is potential unpredictability in the application's performance if the development team fails to update every single instance of the hardcoded constant throughout the code. For these reasons, hard-coding security-relevant constants is considered bad coding practice and should be remedied if present and avoided in future.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n- Never hard code security-related constants; use symbolic names or configuration lookup files.\n- As hard coding is often done by coders working alone on a small scale, examine all legacy code components and test carefully when scaling.\n- Adopt a \"future-proof code\" mindset: While use of constants may save a little time now and make development simpler in the short term, it could cost time and money adapting to scale or other unforeseen circumstances (such as new hardware) in the future.",

Therefore, it is important for developers to design software that considers these real-world physical (or virtual) limitations and limits user sessions accordingly, both in terms of the number of user sessions and in the quantity of resources each user may demand. Software with this weakness does not include such limitations and as a result, individual user sessions may consume too many resources, leading to unintended software behavior including, potentially, denial of service. This can be compared to a single restaurant customer emptying out the entire buffet, leaving no food for other customers--or an entire busload mobbing the buffet all at once, with a similar effect. This may happen inadvertently or as a result of an attack by a malicious user.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Test extensively to obtain baseline values indicating how the software performs in the real world under various conditions (normal and peak); use these values to determine reasonable software limits.\n* Set clear limits for all flexible parameters such as maximum allocable memory, number of processes within a given timeframe, file descriptors, requests per client, number of records per request, etc. This is particularly true for any parameters within user control.\n* Release all resources when no longer in use, including incorporating timeouts for inactive users, processes, and resources.\n* Familiarize Dev, Ops, and IT teams with best practices for recognizing and preventing DoS attacks and out-of-control resource allocation to prevent catastrophic failures.",

The web application server cannot tell the difference between legitimate and malicious requests. This type of attack generally begins by tricking the user with a social engineering attack, such as a link or popup that the user inadvertently clicks, causing an unauthorized request to be sent to the web server. Consequences vary: At a standard user level, attackers can change passwords, transfer funds, make purchases, or connect with contacts; from an administrator account, attackers can then make changes to or even take down the app itself.\n\n### Best practices for prevention\n* Use development frameworks that defend against CSRF, using a nonce, hash, or some other security device to the URL and/or to forms.\n* Implement secure, unique, hidden tokens that are checked by the server each time to validate state-change requests.\n* Never assume that authentication tokens and session identifiers mean a request is legitimate.\n* Understand and implement other safe-cookie techniques, such as double submit cookies.\n* Terminate user sessions when not in use, including automatic timeout.\n* Ensure rigorous coding practices and defenses against other commonly exploited CWEs, since cross-site scripting (XSS), for example, can be used to bypass defenses against CSRF.\n\n## References\n\n* [Express Documentation - Implement CSRF Protection](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/csurf.html)\n* [Node Security Checklist - CSRF](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-security-checklist/#csrf)",
